## 📖 Overview

**ShopStream** is a real-time data pipeline built for simulating and analyzing e-commerce user activity. It demonstrates core data engineering concepts: streaming ingestion, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), storage, warehousing, and visualization using a simple yet flexible tech stack.

The pipeline is modular — making it adaptable to different tools (cloud/on-premise) and perfect for learning or showcasing data engineering skills.
